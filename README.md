# Portfolio Project - Udacity Front-End Web Developer ND

Initially this Portfolio Project was part of the Udacity's Front-End Web developer Nanodegree.

Task was to  develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to the portfolio projects. The design mockup was provided by Udacity as a PDF-file and the task was to replicate that design in HTML and CSS.

## Project Description

A fully responsive portfolio site using `HTML`, `CSS` & `Bootstrap` elements (modals). 

Used a JavaScript task runner `Grunt` to minimize files and produce the responsive images.
